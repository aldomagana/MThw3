A. I asked copilot  "I want you to create a basic yet minimalistic home page for a ecommerce website where you are able to purchase products". I think my prompt was pretty basic and wasn't super detailed but this first question was mostly used to give me a basic website. After asking this prompt I noticed that it made sections for shop, about, contact, and a cart for the nav then i justed prompted copilot to create those pages for me by saying "can you make the shop, about, and contact pages while keeping consistent design across all pages?". My last prompt was to make me a page for the cart "Can you create a page for the cart?". 

B. I think my appraoch stayed the pretty much the same throughout each prompt i think if i had ran into issues or if copilot didn't design the page how i wanted it or it didn't function propperly I would have tried to be a specific as I can when making the prompts.

C. I think what really surprised me was how much it was able to do with just the first prompt. I think it works fast and I think it allows you to start projects a lot faster by giving you a sort of template in order to make it your own.

D. I did not know that you can actually type prompts to help build your code. I've used it before while i'm coding and it will give you suggestions as you code to fill out like functions or guess what you might want to write next.

E. I think I would be a lot more descriptive next time especially if I had a certain idea on how i wanted the page to look. I would also want to play around with the css portion to make it look nicer.
